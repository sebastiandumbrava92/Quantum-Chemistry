Quantum Chemistry: A Field-Theoretic and Operator-Based Framework
===================================================================

**Logline:**  
This book reformulates quantum chemistry by treating molecules as composite quasi-particles described by creation and annihilation operators within a quantum field theory framework, providing a unified perspective on molecular structure, dynamics, and statistical behavior.

**Target Audience:**  
Theoretical chemists, chemical physicists, condensed matter physicists interested in molecular systems, and advanced graduate students. Assumes graduate-level quantum mechanics and some familiarity with quantum chemistry. Basic QFT knowledge is helpful but reviewed.

**Core Philosophy:**  
To bridge the conceptual gap between the fundamental description of matter (QFT/QED) and the practical description of chemical systems (QC), using the language of effective operators and fields to capture emergent molecular behavior.
